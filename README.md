# Transfer_Learning_DogvsHuman
Dog vs Human classifier using transfer learning and CNN models. 

This project was done as a part of Udacity's Deep Learning nano degree and the goal was to build an algorithm to classify humans vs dogs. Further, if classified as a human/dog, a prediction needs to be made about what breed the human/dog has the most resemblence to.
